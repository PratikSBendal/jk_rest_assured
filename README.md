REST API Automation Framework (RestAssured + TestNG + Allure)

This project is a REST API Automation Framework built with RestAssured, TestNG, and Allure Reports using the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.
It provides reusable components for testing APIs such as Books API and Default APIs (Health, Signup, Login).

ðŸš€ Tools & Libraries

Java 11+

Maven

RestAssured â€“ HTTP client for API testing

TestNG â€“ Test runner & reporting

Allure Reports â€“ Rich HTML reports with request/response logs

Jackson / Gson â€“ JSON parsing utilities

âœ¨ Features

âœ… Follows Page Object Model (POM) for APIs

âœ… Reusable Request Builder with Bearer Token support

âœ… Centralized Endpoints management

âœ… Token Management for authenticated requests

âœ… JSON Test Data Driven

âœ… Allure Integration (request & response attachments)

âœ… Supports TestNG suite execution via testng.xml

ðŸ§ª Test Cases

Positive Test Cases

Health Check 

User Signup (Valid Data)

Get Book by ID (Invalid ID)

Update Book (Invalid ID)  


To generate the report:

allure serve target/allure-results

ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

Add DataProvider for multiple book/user test cases

Add Parallel Execution support with TestNG

Integrate with CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins/GitHub Actions)

Extend framework for additional APIs
